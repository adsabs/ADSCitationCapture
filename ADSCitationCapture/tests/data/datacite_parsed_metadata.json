These abundance anomalies are generated by microscopic diffusion acting within the stable envelopes and may be modulated by the&nbsp;competition between many other mixing processes such as convection, rotational mixing and mass loss. The&nbsp;typical patterns encountered are underabundances of Ca and/or Sc as well as overabundances of iron peek&nbsp;elements and rare earths. Non magnetic A stars with such patterns are classified as Am.<br />\nBy observing the surface of A and F stars from open clusters in particular, we can infer additional stellar&nbsp;parameters such as age and initial chemical composition which are invaluable for the comparison with models. &nbsp;Therefore, by determining the surface composition of A and F stars from many clusters of different ages we<br />\ncan follow the evolution of chemical composition and constrain the processes considered in evolutionary models.<br />\nIn this thesis, the surface abundances of 22 elements are presented for 21 A/F stars of the Pleiades open cluster (100 Myr) and for 22 A/F stars of the Coma Berenices open cluster (450 Myr) which were observed with&nbsp;the three spectrographs AURELIE, ELODIE and SOPHIE at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence (OHP). The&nbsp;synthetic spectra method, which is based on ATLAS9-12 atmospheric models, is used in order to determine&nbsp;the abundances. These observations are then compared with evolutionary models from the Montreal group.<br />\nThe results show that there are hydrodynamical processes acting within the radiative zone of these stars and&nbsp;hindering the effects of microscopic diffusion.</p>", "versions": [], "doctype": "misc", "forked_from": [], "affiliations": ["GRAAL, Montpellier"], "citations": [], "references": [], "description_of": [], "authors": ["Gebran, Marwan"], "keywords": ["spectroscopy", "abundances", "A stars", "F stars,", "radiative diffusion", "open clusters: Coma Berenices, Pleiades"], "forks": [], "properties": {"DOI": "10.5281/zenodo.48535", "OPEN": 1}, "version_of": [], "source": "Zenodo"}
